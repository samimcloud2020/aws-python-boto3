The documentation for Image.open says that it can accept a file-like object, so you should be able to pass in a io.BytesIO object created from the bytes object containing the encoded image:

from PIL import Image
import io

image_data = ... # byte values of the image
image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_data))
image.show()
