### Practical Use Case: 
File handling is a common task where with shines, as it guarantees the file is closed properly, preventing resource leaks.
### Error Handling: 
The example includes a try-except block to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found or I/O issues), showing how with integrates with robust code.
### Readability: 
The with statement makes the code concise and clear, avoiding manual calls to file.close().
### Safety: 
Even if an error occurs (e.g., permission issues), the file is automatically closed when the with block exits.

# Key Benefits of with

### Automatic Resource Management: 
No need to manually close resources like files or connections.
### Exception Safety: 
Ensures cleanup even if an error occurs.
### Concise Code: 
Reduces boilerplate code compared to try-finally blocks.
